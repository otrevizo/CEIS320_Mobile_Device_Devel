# CEIS320: Introduction to Mobile Device Development
=====================================================

Supplemental Materials
-----------------------

This repository provides supplemental materials to support your learning experience in CEIS320, which is managed through Canvas. The course introduces principles of Android software development, focusing primarily on design and development for mobile devices. Students will follow design patterns specific to Android development and program a mobile application to publish in the Play Store.

## CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel GitHub Repository

This GitHub repository contains the lab files and supporting materials for CEIS320.

## Options to run Android Studio

You can use a Windows PC, an Apple Mac, or a computer running Linux. You have three options to run Android Studio and do the labs.

<ul>
<li> CEIS320 Azure Labs: A Virtual Machine (VM) created for each student by the school. This is the official approach. Students receive instructions on Canvas and via email from the school.</li>
<li> VirtualBox VM: Use a VM running as host running Linux on your computer.</li>
<li> Install Android Studio directly on your computer.</li>
</ul>

#### Supplemental YouTube playlist to use VirtualBox:

## Cloning and Syncing the Repository

#### The VM already has this repository cloned:

This was the command used to clone the repository. No need to run it again in your VM. Do not run these commands in your VM. I already did it for you. I am sharing the commands here as reference, FYI.

cd ~/GitHub
git clone CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel.git

#### To sync your cloned repository with the latest changes, run:

During class, I will let you know if and when I made any updates and you will do a pull as follows in your VM:

cd ~/GitHub/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel

git pull origin main

## Working on Labs

#### Important:

Leave the ~/GitHub/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel repository intact and do not modify it. Instead, work on the copied repository in ~/MyLabs.

The ~/MyLabs folder has all your labs ready for you to work on.
