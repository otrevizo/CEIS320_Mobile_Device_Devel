=====================================================

Supplemental Materials
-----------------------

This repository provides supplemental materials to support your learning experience in CEIS320, which is managed through Canvas. The course introduces principles of Android software development, focusing primarily on design and development for mobile devices. Students will follow design patterns specific to Android development and program a mobile application to publish in the Play Store.

## Options to run Android Studio

You can use a Windows PC, an Apple Mac, or a computer running Linux. You have three options to run Android Studio and do the labs.

<ul>
<li> CEIS320 Azure Labs: A Virtual Machine (VM) created for each student by the school (FYI, this is the official approach in school).</li>
<li> VirtualBox VM: Use a VM running as host running Linux on your computer. Install Java and Android Studio on your VM.</li>
<li> Install Android Studio directly on your computer.</li>
</ul>

#### Supplemental YouTube playlist to use VirtualBox:

## Cloning and Syncing the Repository

#### Cloning the repository:

Recommend using a folder named GitHub, but it is up to you.

cd ~/GitHub
git clone https://github.com/otrevizo/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel.git

#### Syncing the cloned repository:

During class, I will let you know when I make any updates and you will do a pull as follows in your VM:

cd ~/GitHub/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel
git pull origin main

## Working on Labs

Copy the cloned repository (the folder that appears on your computer or VM) to a new directory, for exampe ~/MyLabs on a VM.

Leave the ~/GitHub/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel repository intact, i.e., do not modify it. Instead, work on the copied repository in ~/MyLabs.

The ~/MyLabs folder has all your labs ready for you to work on.
