## Creating the VirtualBox Virtual Machine (VM)

#### To create the VM from the CEIS320.ova file:

1. Download the CEIS320.ova file from Canvas.
2. Open VirtualBox and click on "File" > "Import Appliance".
3. Select the CEIS320.ova file and follow the prompts to create the VM.
4. Once the import is complete, start the VM and log in with the provided credentials.

## Using the VirtualBox Virtual Machine (VM)

To make it easier to work on labs, we've set up a VirtualBox Virtual Machine (VM) with all the necessary tools and software.

## Cloning and Syncing the Repository

#### The VM already has this repository cloned:

This was the command used to clone the repository. No need to run it again in your VM.

git clone CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel.git

#### To sync your cloned repository with the latest changes, run:

During class, I will let you know if and when I made any updates foryou to do a pull as follows:

cd ~/GitHub/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel

git pull origin main

## Working on Labs

#### Important:

Leave the ~/GitHub/CEIS320_Mobile_Device_Devel repository intact and do not modify it. Instead, work on the copied repository in ~/MyLabs.
